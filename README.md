# Hand-Gesture-Recognition
- An application of Hand Gesture Recognition.

- Used OpenCV to capture live video through webcam and recognize hand gestures.

- On detection of defects in the contour bearing rectangle, pyautogui presses the 'space' key, and thus can be used to play Google's Dino Game.

- Can be further enhanced for automation of various functions such as adjusting brightness/volume using hand gestures.
